/*
An object is very similar to an array but with the difference that you define the keys
yourself. You're not limited to using only numeric indexes but can use friendlier
keys, such as first_name, age, and so on.
Let's take a look at a simple object and examine its parts:

var hero = {
  breed: 'Turtle',
  occupation: 'Ninja'
};
